package model

// Credential inventory wire types.
//
// A finding says which category of credential material lives at a location,
// where it is, and how well protected it is. It never carries the credential —
// no value, no substring, no digest, no fingerprint, and no category derived
// from the secret's own characters. Protection state is derived by reading
// secret-bearing bytes (a key container's structure, whether a field holds a
// concrete value), which describes how material is guarded rather than what it
// is.
//
// A finding means material was found in the file: a concrete value in a field
// the tool consumes as authentication, or a structurally valid private key. A
// file that only names a credential held elsewhere — a helper, an environment
// reference, a single-sign-on session — is not a finding, and neither is a file
// this build could not interpret. The second travels as an error instead, so an
// uninterpretable file cannot read as a clean one.

// Credential categories. The customer-facing grouping a finding rolls up to.
